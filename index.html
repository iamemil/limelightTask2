            <p>a Dutch post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. </p>
              <p>In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. </p>
              <p>They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.</p> 
              <p>He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.</p> 
              <p>His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. </p>
